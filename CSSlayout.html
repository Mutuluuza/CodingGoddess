  <h1>Basic document flow</h1>
<p class="p1">
  I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
  lines below me.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
  as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
  border width/height.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
  separated by the size of one of our margins, not both.
</p>
<p class="p1">
  Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on
  the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same
  line. Overflowing inline elements will
  <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>,
  or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:

<div class="box">Eldoria's United Victory ðŸ˜Š</div>
<p class="special">
    Once upon a time, nestled in the heart of a lush valley, 
    there was a local kingdom named Eldoria. 
    Eldoria was renowned for its breathtaking landscapes, 
    with emerald forests, sparkling rivers, 
    and towering mountains. 
    The kingdom was ruled by the wise and benevolent King Arion, 
    who was deeply loved by his people. 
    His daughter, Princess Elara, was known for her kindness and compassion, 
    often seen helping the villagers and tending to the gardens.
</p>
<p>
    One fateful day, a mysterious traveler arrived in Eldoria, 
    bringing news of an impending threat from a neighboring realm. 
    The kingdom's peace was at risk, and the people looked to King Arion for guidance. 
    The king, with his unwavering wisdom, decided to form an alliance with nearby kingdoms,
    uniting their forces to protect their homeland. 
    As preparations for defense began, 
    Princess Elara played a crucial role in rallying the spirits of the people and ensuring that everyone felt supported during this challenging time.
</p>
<p>
    Through their combined efforts, 
    Eldoria and its allies successfully thwarted the impending invasion, 
    and peace was restored to the valley. 
    The kingdom emerged stronger and more united than ever before. 
    The people of Eldoria celebrated their victory with a grand festival,
    honoring the bravery and unity that had saved their beloved home. 
    From that day forward, Eldoria's story became a symbol of resilience and the power of coming together in the face of adversity.
